# post-eval

This is a test designed to measure proficiency in the `numpy` python package.

`main.py` contains a number of programming exercises.  For each exercise, please complete the missing part of the function.

The calls to `check_correctness` will check the output of your function against a reference implementation.  `check_correctness` will return `True` if your implementation is correct, and `False` otherwise.

When you're finished, please run `python validate.py` to generate a results file in `results/results.json`.

__You are not expected to be able to complete all of the exercises in the time allotted.  Please help up by strictly following the time limit.__

Good luck!
